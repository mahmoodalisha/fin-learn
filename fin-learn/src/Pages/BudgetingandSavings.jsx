    <h1> <br />What is Financial Literacy?</h1>
    <p> <br />Financial literacy is the cognitive understanding of financial components and skills such as budgeting, investing, borrowing, taxation, and personal financial management. <br />
    The absence of such skills is referred to as being financially illiterate. <br />
    According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), about 66% of the American population is considered financially illiterate.

Being financially literate allows an individual to be better prepared for specific financial roadblocks, which, in turn, decreases the chances of personal economic distress.

Achieving financial literacy is crucial in todayâ€™s society due to everyday facets of life, such as student loans, mortgages, credit cards, investments, and health insurance. <br /></p>
<h1> <br />Why is Financial Literacy so important?</h1>
<p> <br />From day-to-day expenses to long-term budget forecasting, financial literacy is crucial for managing these factors. It is important to plan and save enough to provide adequate income in retirement while avoiding high levels of debt that might result in bankruptcy, defaults, and foreclosures.




Though these may seem like individual problems, they have a wider effect on the entire population than previously believed. All one needs is to look at the financial crisis of 2008 to see the financial impact on the entire economy that arose from a lack of understanding of mortgage products (creating a vulnerability to predatory lending). Financial literacy is an issue with broad implications for economic health.
