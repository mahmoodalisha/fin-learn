      <h1>How to write SMART financial goals</h1>
      <p>Have you ever dreamed of saving enough money to buy a car, travel, or retire comfortably?
         These are examples of financial goals. Financial goals can help you plan your budget,
          track your progress, and stay motivated. <br /> <br /> But not all financial goals are created equal. Some goals are vague, unrealistic, or hard to measure, which can make them difficult to reach. For example, saying "I want to save more money" is not a very helpful goal, because it does not explain how much money,
           why you want to save, or when you need the money to be saved by.</p>
